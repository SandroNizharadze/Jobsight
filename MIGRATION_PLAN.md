# Migration Plan: Transitioning to the New Architecture

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for migrating the existing Jobsy codebase to the new architecture that follows SOLID principles.

## Phase 1: Model Refactoring

1. **Create the models directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p core/models
   ```

2. **Create base models**
   - Create `core/models/__init__.py`
   - Create `core/models/base.py` with `SoftDeletionModel` and related classes

3. **Split models.py into domain-specific files**
   - Create `core/models/job.py` for `JobListing` and related models
   - Create `core/models/user.py` for `UserProfile` and related models
   - Create `core/models/employer.py` for `EmployerProfile` and related models
   - Create `core/models/application.py` for `JobApplication` and related models
   - Create `core/models/blog.py` for blog-related models
   - Create `core/models/pricing.py` for pricing-related models
   - Create `core/models/auth.py` for authentication-related models

4. **Update imports in existing code**
   - Replace `from core.models import X` with appropriate imports from the new structure
   - Run tests to ensure everything still works

## Phase 2: Repository Layer Implementation

1. **Create the repositories directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p core/repositories
   ```

2. **Create repository classes**
   - Create `core/repositories/__init__.py`
   - Create `core/repositories/job_repository.py` for job-related data access
   - Create `core/repositories/application_repository.py` for application-related data access
   - Create `core/repositories/employer_repository.py` for employer-related data access

3. **Move data access logic from views to repositories**
   - Identify data access patterns in views and services
   - Create repository methods for these patterns
   - Update tests to use repositories

## Phase 3: Service Layer Implementation

1. **Create the services directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p core/services
   ```

2. **Create service classes**
   - Create `core/services/__init__.py`
   - Create `core/services/job_service.py` for job-related business logic
   - Create `core/services/employer_service.py` for employer-related business logic

3. **Move business logic from views to services**
   - Identify business logic in views
   - Create service methods for this logic
   - Update services to use repositories for data access
   - Update tests to use services

## Phase 4: View Refactoring

1. **Create the views directory structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p core/views/employer_views
   ```

2. **Split views into domain-specific files**
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/__init__.py`
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/dashboard.py` for dashboard views
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/job_management.py` for job management views
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/application_management.py` for application management views
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/cv_database.py` for CV database views
   - Create `core/views/employer_views/profile.py` for profile-related views

3. **Update views to use services**
   - Replace direct data access with service calls
   - Update tests to mock services

## Phase 5: Testing and Validation

1. **Update existing tests**
   - Ensure all tests pass with the new architecture
   - Add new tests for repositories and services

2. **Perform integration testing**
   - Test the complete flow from views through services to repositories
   - Fix any issues found

3. **Performance testing**
   - Compare performance before and after refactoring
   - Optimize if necessary

## Phase 6: Cleanup and Documentation

1. **Remove deprecated code**
   - Delete the original monolithic files once migration is complete
   - Update imports to use the new structure

2. **Update documentation**
   - Document the new architecture
   - Update developer guidelines

3. **Knowledge transfer**
   - Train the team on the new architecture
   - Review the migration with the team

## Implementation Strategy

To minimize disruption, we'll follow these strategies:

1. **Incremental migration**: Refactor one component at a time
2. **Parallel implementation**: Keep the old code working while developing the new structure
3. **Feature flags**: Use feature flags to gradually switch to the new implementation
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Ensure thorough testing at each step

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:

1. **Identify the problem**: Determine if it's a design issue or implementation bug
2. **Fix in place**: If possible, fix the issue without rolling back
3. **Partial rollback**: Roll back only the problematic component
4. **Complete rollback**: If necessary, revert to the previous architecture

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Model Refactoring | 1 week | None |
| Repository Layer | 1 week | Model Refactoring |
| Service Layer | 1 week | Repository Layer |
| View Refactoring | 2 weeks | Service Layer |
| Testing and Validation | 1 week | All previous phases |
| Cleanup and Documentation | 1 week | All previous phases |

Total estimated time: 7 weeks

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from the current monolithic architecture to a clean, SOLID-compliant architecture. By following this plan, we can achieve a more maintainable, testable, and flexible codebase with minimal disruption to ongoing development.
