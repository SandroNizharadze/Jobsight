# Jobsy Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Jobsy application, explaining how it follows SOLID principles and other best practices.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Models Layer**: Domain entities and data structures
2. **Repository Layer**: Data access and persistence
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic and use cases
4. **View Layer**: Presentation and user interaction

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single responsibility:

- **Models**: Represent domain entities and their relationships
- **Repositories**: Handle data access and persistence
- **Services**: Implement business logic and use cases
- **Views**: Handle user interaction and presentation

For example:
- `JobRepository` is responsible only for job-related data access
- `JobService` is responsible only for job-related business logic
- `employer_dashboard` view is responsible only for displaying the employer dashboard

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The architecture is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification:

- New functionality can be added by creating new services without modifying existing ones
- New data access patterns can be added by extending repositories
- New views can be added without changing existing ones

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The architecture uses inheritance appropriately:

- `SoftDeletionModel` provides a base class for models that support soft deletion
- Derived models like `JobListing` and `EmployerProfile` properly extend this functionality

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The architecture defines focused, specific interfaces:

- Repository methods are specific to their use cases
- Service methods provide clear, focused functionality
- Views handle specific user interactions

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The architecture depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations:

- Services depend on repository interfaces, not implementations
- Views depend on service interfaces, not implementations
- This allows for easier testing and flexibility

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Maintainability**: Code is organized by feature and responsibility, making it easier to maintain
2. **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with new features
4. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand
5. **Scalability**: Can scale different parts of the application independently

## Example Flow

Here's an example of how a request flows through the architecture:

1. User requests to view job applications for a specific job
2. `job_applications` view in `application_management.py` handles the request
3. View calls `ApplicationRepository.get_applications_by_job()` to get the data
4. Repository retrieves the data from the database
5. View renders the template with the data

## Conclusion

This architecture follows SOLID principles and best practices, resulting in a more maintainable, testable, and flexible codebase. By separating concerns and defining clear responsibilities, the code is easier to understand and extend.
